🚀 Getting Started (Development)
1. Clone the project
git clone your-repo-url-here
cd your-project-folder

2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up environment variables

Copy .env.example → .env:

cp .env.example .env


At minimum set:

SECRET_KEY=change-this

5. Run the app in development mode
flask --app app.py run --debug


Then visit:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

🏭 Running in Production

We use Waitress as the production server.

Run with:

python run_prod.py


Waitress will default to:

http://0.0.0.0:8000


Production environments overwrite PORT.

☸ Deployment Options
🔹 Heroku / Railway (Procfile)

A simple Procfile is included:

web: python run_prod.py


Push your repository and both platforms will auto-detect Python + install requirements.

🔹 Docker Deployment
Build image
docker build -t care-broker .

Run container with mounted uploads
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/static/uploads:/app/static/uploads \
  --env-file .env \
  care-broker

Stop the container
docker ps
docker stop <container-id>

⚙ Environment Variables

.env.example shows everything required:

SECRET_KEY=your-secret
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///care_broker.db
DIGEST_TASK_TOKEN=your-token

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=your-email@example.com

Production Deployment Tips

Always use a strong SECRET_KEY

If running multiple containers, use Postgres instead of SQLite

Use a secrets manager (Railway/Render/Heroku env vars)

📸 File Uploads

Listing photos are stored in:

static/uploads/


Cover image = first uploaded file or any is_cover=True.

If you deploy using Docker, remember to mount this folder or you’ll lose uploads on redeploy.
